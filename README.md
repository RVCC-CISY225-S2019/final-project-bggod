BEVERLY GARCIA-GODOY/ABOUT ME FINAL PROJECT/ WEB DEVELOPMENT 1

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project is meant to display skills that have been learned throughout the Spring 2019 semester in web development 1. With these skills, a website that serves to display and inform the audience as to who the developer/student that coded the website is. With the inclusion of information ranging from a pictures to personal info as well as a means of communicating with the student who developed the website. This project is meant to be responsive as well as keeping in mind the design principles that developers must keep in mind when creating public/accessible websites.

CREATED FOR?:
This was created to be seen and displayed to the class and professor of web development 1 as the final project to showcase skills learned throughout the course.

HOW TO USE:
This project will need to be downloaded or cloned from Github in order to obtain all the necessary content and files such as images. In order to edit and view code and watch changes occur to code, having a text editor would be useful as well as having an up to date web browser in order to view the page will be necessary.
This website is meant to work on multiple platforms from web to mobile.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROJECT:
This project serves the purpose of  showcasing different skills learned throughout the course as well as being creative with one's about me page. This project is meant to be seen by peers and the class professor during an in-class presentation.

KEY FEATURES:
Throughout the website, the images have some sort of interactivity with at least changing opacity levels and certain filters when hovering over it with a mouse. The hover feature is meant to display how dynamic a feature such as hover can be in making a website a bit more interesting. NOTE: Hover is best on computers with mouses rather than mobile devices that cannot use mouses to hover.

BENEFITS:
While this project may not benefit most of the audience because of its simplicity, it will at least benefit the developer (in this case me) when it comes to understanding and implementing the code I've been taught as well as I have been able to search the internet for.
